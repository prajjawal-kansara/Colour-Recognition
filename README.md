<h3>Area / Domain of Project:</h3>
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
In response to the growing importance of color recognition in various applications,  
this study delves into the realm of machine learning to address the challenges
associated with accurate and efficient color recognition. The existing methods for 
color recognition often face limitations in terms of adaptability to diverse 
environments and robustness against variations in lighting conditions. The aim is 
to enhance the precision and versatility of color recognition systems, filling the gap 
in current methodologies. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, particularly 
deep learning models, this research intends to develop a more sophisticated and 
adaptive color recognition system capable of handling real-world scenarios. The 
significance lies in the broader applications, ranging from computer vision and 
image processing to assistive technologies and product quality control. Addressing 
these challenges not only contributes to the advancement of color recognition 
technology but also facilitates progress in various fields where accurate color 
identification is pivotal.
